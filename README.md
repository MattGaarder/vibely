# Vibely

Vibely is all about the good Vibes. A new social media feed that focuses around your circle and lets you decide if something was a vibe or...NOT A VIBE!

## Background and Concept

We wanted to create a new social media app that got rid of some of the clutter of others. Instead of bombarding you with politics, current events and devisive posts we want you to be abel to see posts that are fun and related to your circle. You can then decide if someones post is NOT A VIBE!

## Technologies

The site was built using React with a number of packages to quickly spin up the site. We used MaterialUI components to quickly develop the user interface and each took charge of building a specific component for the site. Initially we started generating fake user data with Faker.js but quickly decided to challenge ourselves to implement a backend. Firebase became our chosen solution and we used its authentication services to allow users to sign up and login as well as Firestore to save user data and their vibes.
